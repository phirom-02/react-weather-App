## Reflection
Based on the feedback about the `Todo List App` I received from the AnB developer from AnB HQ last time about error handling, I have implemented it well in the current `Weather App` project.

**i.e.**, If users have no internet connectivity or do not allow the browser to access the location, It would display the Error UI with instructions to solve the error problems.

## What I Have Learned?

By building this project, I have learned how to :
- Setup reusable API urls with Axios JavaScript library.
- Create custom hooks.
- Build reusable components
- Fetch data from an API and render it on a web interface
- Make folder structure stay more organized
- Write better comments
- Error handling
- Setup Eslint and Prettier for consistent and clean code.

Also I have improved my understanding of Git/Github about :
- How to write better commit messages
- The importance of code reviews
- Working Git flow extension
- How to solve branch divergance.

**Honorable Mention**

- This project wouldn't have been done without the guidance and the code references of fellow AnB student Mr. Moonlight, and the way he inspired me to do things like:
  - How should I organize my folder structure professionally, as doing this will help me be a better developer.
  - How should I write comments in my code.
  - How should I use certain development tools to achieve better application performance.
  - How should I structure my code, like:
    - Setting up the API.
    - Handling the API data with React state management...
  - How should I manage my project.
  - Overall, what I experienced with his work really excites me because it is something I was looking for when I joined AnB school.
- Thanks, to the other fellow AnB student as well, without their helps I definitely could not finish this project on time.
- I also owe a big shoutout to the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) for the free developer subscription.
